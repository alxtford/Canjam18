TUTORIAL:
Attention recruit! They've put you in charge of piloting this beauty of a vehicle, and it's my job to make sure that you don't screw it up.
Move the joy stick left and right to aim and hit that button to fire. If your enemy explodes, you know you've done good.
When you take enough damage, you'll explode. Be ready to flick that switch to eject.
